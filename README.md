# Maze Generator

Given user inputed dimensions of a maze (x,y) the program generates a x*y cells that are seperated by walls. The program keeps breaking walls until each cell component is connected, checking with Union Find, and making a solveable maze because from any point in the maze there exists a path to any other point in the maze.
